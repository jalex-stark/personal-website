<h1>Caltech Undergraduate Math Seminar</h1>

<h2>Winter 2017</h2>

<section id="parag" title="basics">
<p><br />
Welcome to the webpage for the Caltech <a href="http://math.caltech.edu/">mathematics</a> undergraduate seminar. The seminar is held two to four times per month, on <b>Fridays from 12:00pm to 1:00pm in 151 Sloan.</b> The talks are given by and for Caltech undergrads. Pizza is typically served. We are thankful to the Caltech <a href="math.caltech.edu">math department</a>, the <a href="https://teachlearn.caltech.edu/about">Center for Teaching, Learning, and Outreach</a>, and the <a href="http://ascit.inc">Associated Students of the California Institute of Technology</a> for funding.<br />

<p>The primary goal of the undergraduate math club is to foster a community among caltech undergraduates interested in math,&nbsp;breaking&nbsp;divisions across social groups and forming connections outside of&nbsp;the &quot;is taking a class concurrently with&quot; graph. Additionally, the club serves to foster the speaking ability of young mathematicians through its mentorship program: senior members of the club meet with underclassmen to nurture ideas for talks, to give general advice on talk-giving, and to give specific feedback on practice talks.&nbsp;</p>

	<li><b>January 6.</b> <a href="http://www.jalexstark.com/">Jalex Stark,</a> senior in mathematics.<br />
	Title: Wizards vs. Time Machines<br />
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showDiv('Stark5','Stark6')" style="float:left">Abstract: </a>

	Suppose you&#39;re interested in solving some computational problems, but you are a puny, polynomially bounded computational agent. You live in a magical realism fiction world, so you have two options to expand your power: either you can have a chat with an infinitely wise wizard, (who may or may not be trying to deceive you) or you can employ the use of a time machine. Which of these options is more powerful?<br />
	They turn out to be the same! Formally, we&#39;ll discuss the equality QIP = IP = PSPACE = BPP<sub>CTC</sub> = BQP<sub>CTC</sub>. Each of these equalities is a marvelous theorem in its own right. The first was proven by Jain, Ji, Upadhyay, and Watrous in 2009, the second by Shamir in 1992, and the last two by Aaronson and Watrous also in 2009.<br />
	The theorems discussed are deep, but this talk is aimed at those without formal exposure to complexity theory. We&#39;ll spend lots of time motivating the definitions and working with examples, while only touching on a few ideas from the proofs of the main theorems.<br />
	Related classes: CS 21, CS 151.</div>

	<li><b>January 13.</b> Felix Weilacher, sophomore in mathematics.<br />
	Title: The Erdős distinct distances problem<br />

	<div id="Weilacher2" style="display:none"><br />
	Throw n points randomly onto a plane, and you should expect to have on the order of n2 distinct distances between pairs of those points. Place those points carefully, and you can make that number much smaller. The Erdős distinct distances problem asks just how small you can make it as n grows large. We will use some elementary graph theory to find a lower bound for the answer, and a result of Landau to find an upper bound. We&rsquo;ll then look at what kind of improvements to our bounds have been obtained over the years, ending with the very recent result of Katz and Guth.</div>

	<li><b>January 20.</b> Tynan Ochse, junior in mathematics.<br />
	Title: Some Aspects of Arithmetic Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds<br />

	<div id="Ochse4" style="display:none"><br />
	Shapes that take on certain nice forms (i.e manifolds) encode much more data than meets the eye; e.g. given the plane R<sup>2</sup> and the group Z &oplus; Z, one can &quot;build&quot; a torus. Similar ideas give us practical descriptions of more complicated shapes in higher dimensions, and one such class of shapes --- the arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds --- find exceptionally common ground in topology, geometry, and number theory. The goal of this talk is to show some ways in which knots, geodesics, and eigenvalues of the Laplacian interplay in the study of these manifolds. The treatment of the topic will be as elementary as possible, only presupposing the existence of an imagination as well as exposure to the notion of a linear transformation and a group.<br />

	<li><b>January 27.</b> Sam Bardwell-Evans, junior in mathematics.<br />

	<div id="SamBE2" style="display:none"><br />
	We return to the Erdős Distinct Distances Problem in R<sup>2</sup>, as introduced in the earlier talk by Felix Weilacher: what is the least number of distinct distances a set of n points in R<sup>2</sup> can determine?<br />
	We will begin by looking at an outline of the proof given by Guth and Katz of the best known lower bound, which relies heavily on turning the problem of counting repeated distances into one of counting incidences of lines in R<sup>3</sup>. We will then look at work that is being done with Adam Sheffer to extend this proof to a general analogue of the original problem, namely the Erdős Distinct Distances Problem in the d-sphere. In particular, we will look in detail at the subsets T<sub>AB</sub> of Spin(d) consisting of transformations bringing a given point A in S<sup>d</sup> to a given point B, and we will look at how one can map these subsets onto d(d-1)/2-dimensional planes in R<sup>d(d+1)/2</sup>.</div>

	The simply laced Dynkin diagrams --- the graphs A<sub>n</sub>, D<sub>n</sub>, E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, and E<sub>8</sub> --- are surprisingly ubiquitous throughout mathematics. In this talk, we&#39;ll give a simple combinatorial characterization of these graphs, and then mention several natural classification problems whose solutions are given by the Dynkin diagrams. Finally, we&#39;ll discuss how certain small-n coincidences in the Dynkin diagrams relate to other exceptional objects, including the non-simplicity of the alternating group Alt<sub>4</sub>, the fact that one can draw a tetrahedron with integer vertex coordinates, and the existence of the quaternions and octonions.</div>

	Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob, say by sending a burst of radio waves that can be picked up by Bob&#39;s transceiver. Due to physics, Bob doesn&#39;t receive exactly the same message that Alice intended to send. However, Bob&#39;s received message is known to deviate in one of a small number of ways from Alice&#39;s intended message. How should Alice and Bob work together to maximize the usefulness of this channel? In this talk, we&#39;ll set up a rigorous framework in which to study this question, and see that very simple cases have been open problems for a long time!</div>

	<li><b>Oct 15th.</b> Tynan Ochse, junior in mathematics.<br />
	Title: Abundant, Deficient, and Weird Numbers<br />

	<div id="Ochse2" style="display:none"><br />
	Have you ever looked at a particular number and thought &quot;wow, that is a weird number&quot;? I claim that your number is nearly three times as likely to be odd than weird. In this talk we will extend the notion of a perfect number and define precisely what it means for a natural number to be weird. In particular we will look at some examples of weird numbers and show that they are sufficiently abundant to make my claim meaningful.</div>

	<li><b>October 28th.</b> Jalex Stark, senior in mathematics.<br />
	Title: Welzl&#39;s Theorem on Graph Homomorphisms<br />
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showDiv('Stark1','Stark2')" style="float:left">Abstract: </a>
	<div id="Stark1" style="display:block">(Click to show)</div>

	<div id="Stark2" style="display:none"><br />
	The rational numbers with their usual order are dense. Welzl&#39;s theorem says that the class of finite graphs, with a suitably natural order, are also dense! We&#39;ll give some category-theoretic background to motivate this result, and then we&#39;ll give the proof in full detail. The proof of the main theorem will be accessible to those with limited background.</div>

	<li><b>November 11th.</b> Milan Roberson, freshman in mathematics.<br />
	Title: Fermat&#39;s Little Theorem and Euler&#39;s Theorem in the Gaussian Integers<br />
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showDiv('Roberson1','Roberson2')" style="float:left">Abstract: </a>
	<div id="Roberson1" style="display:block">(Click to show)</div>

	<div id="Roberson2" style="display:none"><br />
	We prove Fermat&#39;s Little Theorem using reduced residue systems and modular arithmetic (Ivory and Dirichlet) and briefly explore parity, primality, and Mersenne prime analogs in the Gaussian integers in order to motivate extending Fermat&#39;s Little Theorem to the Gaussian integers. We extend Euler&#39;s Theorem to the Gaussian integers and find a formula for computing Euler&#39;s phi function over the Gaussian integers.</div>

	<li><b>November 18th.</b> <a href="http://cnirkhe.com/">Chinmay Nirkhe,</a> senior in mathematics and computer science.<br />
	Title: Quantum Pseudo-Telepathy Games and Entangled State Dimension<br />
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showDiv('Nirkhe1','Nirkhe2')" style="float:left">Abstract: </a>
	<div id="Nirkhe1" style="display:block">(Click to show)</div>

	<div id="Nirkhe2" style="display:none"><br />
	One of the reasons why we study quantum mechanics is to explain phenomenon that classical physics cannot. Today, we explore the topic of quantum pseudo-telepathy games, a demonstration of such a phenomenon. In a two-player pseudo-telepathy game, Alice and Bob are individually asked a question to which they provide a response without any form of communication once the questions are asked, but they may have agreed on a common strategy prior to the execution of the game. A game exhibits pseudo-telepathy if there is a quantum strategy that makes Alice and Bob win the game for all possible questions, provided they share prior entanglement, but no such classical strategy exists. We specifically explore the GHZ game and discuss what about quantum mechanics allows this violation.</div>

	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showDiv('Juusola1','Juusola2')" style="float:left">Abstract: </a>
	<div id="Juusola1" style="display:block">(Click to show)</div>

	<div id="Juusola2" style="display:none"><br />
	We begin by proving a special case of Chinese Remainder Theorem -- for integers. Then we proceed to look at a couple examples of the general theorem for commutative rings with 1. Finally, we will discuss Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem and how it can be optimized using CRT.</div>
