<p>To see the donation amounts as a fraction of my pre-tax income, click the header of the second column. To see the donation amounts as a number of dollars, click the header of the third column. If you click both, you learn the amount of my pre-tax income. Many social circles have taboos around that, so think before you click.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>GiveDirectly &quot;gives cash directly to people living in poverty.&quot;<br />
			They measure&nbsp;their impact in peer-reviewed randomized control trials. One of their studies claims an impact per $1000 transferred of:&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">$</span>270 increase in earnings, <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">$</span>430 increase in assets, <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">$</span>330 increase in annual nutrition spend,&nbsp;0% effect on alcohol&nbsp;or tobacco spend.</p>

			<td>
			<p>I have not studied their methodology directly. The key (anec)data that drive my donations are excerpts from interviews with transfer recipients. They describe using the money for things like water-resistant roofing, schooling for children, and building wells.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Here I optimize jointly for the probability that my donation improves some specific person&#39;s lives and the expected value of the magnitude of improvement.</p>

			<p>&quot;Ought is a research lab that develops mechanisms for delegating open-ended thinking to advanced machine learning systems. We study this delegation problem using experiments with human participants.&quot;</p>

			<p>I read their published research program in depth, and I find the directions promising. It is one of three places I was willing to leave grad school to be employed at. (The other two were Jane Street, where I currently work, and OpenAI, which is much more well funded than Ought.)</p>

			<p>I aim to eventually transition to direct technical work on problems that require theoretical contributions from individuals thinking deeply for a long time. With this work I&#39;m aiming to support the efforts of agents that are similar to future-me.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&quot;BEAM asks itself, &#39;what do most scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and programmers do growing up?&#39;&nbsp;and then, &#39;how can we bring those same opportunities to underserved students?&#39;&nbsp;</p>

			<p>BEAM then creates a series of experiences for students in grades 6-12: a 6th grade summer program in Los Angeles and New York City; a 7th grade residential summer program on college campuses; advising from 8th-12th grade to help students attend great high schools, pass algebra in 8th grade, access other enrichment programs, and ultimately go to a great college. &nbsp;Students declaring STEM majors even get support during college. &nbsp;Through our work, BEAM helps to diversify other enrichment programs and gives students a realistic chance at the career of their dreams.&quot;</p>

			<p>I worked at BEAM as a counselor in their residential summer program for 7th graders. Since moving to NYC, I&#39;ve taught classes in their Saturday continuing enrichment program ~10 times.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>I consider this in part a &quot;local&quot; donation to people that live near me (the students in general) and people that I know personally (students I&#39;ve worked with and staffpeople that are my close friends).</p>
