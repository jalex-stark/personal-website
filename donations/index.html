<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a> pledge, I aim to give at least 10% of my pre-tax income to charities that I deem effective at making the world better. Here I report which charities I made donations to and in what proportions. I give some explanation of what each organization is and why I chose to give to it. These are not meant to be comprehensive. For in-depth third-party research about the work done by some of the world&#39;s most* effective charities, I recommend GiveWell. (If you like meta-causes, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> may be a good donation target for you.)</p>

<p>Please get in touch&nbsp;if you think my donation patterns disagree significantly with what you think my values are.&nbsp;(Find my email address and my anonymous feedback form on my main page.)</p>


<p>Here is a summary of my lifetime donations, up-to-date as of Jan 2022.</p>

			<p>GiveDirectly &quot;gives cash directly to people living in poverty.&quot;<br />
			They measure&nbsp;their impact in peer-reviewed randomized control trials. One of their studies claims an impact per $1000 transferred of:&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">$</span>270 increase in earnings, <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">$</span>430 increase in assets, <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">$</span>330 increase in annual nutrition spend,&nbsp;0% effect on alcohol&nbsp;or tobacco spend.</p>

			<p>See summaries and links to their papers <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/research-at-give-directly/">here.</a></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>I have not studied their methodology directly. The key (anec)data that drive my donations are excerpts from interviews with transfer recipients. They describe using the money for things like water-resistant roofing, schooling for children, and building wells.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Here I optimize jointly for the probability that my donation improves some specific person&#39;s lives and the expected value of the magnitude of improvement.</p>

			<p>&quot;Ought is a research lab that develops mechanisms for delegating open-ended thinking to advanced machine learning systems. We study this delegation problem using experiments with human participants.&quot;</p>

			<p>I read their published research program in depth, and I find the directions promising.</p>

			<p>I aim to eventually transition to direct technical work on problems that require theoretical contributions from individuals thinking deeply for a long time. With this work I&#39;m aiming to support the efforts of agents that are similar to future-me.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&quot;BEAM asks itself, &#39;what do most scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and programmers do growing up?&#39;&nbsp;and then, &#39;how can we bring those same opportunities to underserved students?&#39;&nbsp;</p>

			<p>BEAM then creates a series of experiences for students in grades 6-12: a 6th grade summer program in Los Angeles and New York City; a 7th grade residential summer program on college campuses; advising from 8th-12th grade to help students attend great high schools, pass algebra in 8th grade, access other enrichment programs, and ultimately go to a great college. &nbsp;Students declaring STEM majors even get support during college. &nbsp;Through our work, BEAM helps to diversify other enrichment programs and gives students a realistic chance at the career of their dreams.&quot;</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>I worked at BEAM as a counselor in their residential summer program for 7th graders. &nbsp;</p>

			<p>I consider this in part a &quot;local&quot; donation to people that live near me (the students in general) and people that I know personally (students I&#39;ve worked with and staffpeople that are my close friends).</p>
