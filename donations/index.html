<p>As part of the GWWC pledge, I aim to give at least 10% of my pre-tax income to charities that I deem effective at making the world better. Here I report which charities I made donations to and in what proportions. I give some explanation of what each organization is and why I chose to give to it. These are not meant to be comprehensive. For in-depth third-party research about the work done by some of the world&#39;s most* effective charities, I recommend GiveWell. (If you like meta-causes, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> may be a good donation target for you.)</p>

<p>Please get in touch&nbsp;if you think my donation patterns disagree significantly with what you think my values are.&nbsp;(Find my email address and my anonymous feedback form on my main page.)</p>
